DOM Maker
=========

Purpose
=======
Provide a library that lets programmers build DOM dynamically using a syntax that is at least as short and readable as HTML, while providing all the benefits of using the JavaScript DOM construction methods, including inherent protection against HTML injection through text strings, and using functions with scope as event handlers.

The library should itself be short and easily readable. Rather than the library providing functionality for all eventualities, it should be easy to use the library with custom code for dealing with such eventualities, or to change the library to suit individual needs.

Content of repository
=====================
The entire library is contained in the file dom.js. Guide_selftest.htm contain a project description, and instructions on the use of the library. It also serves as a simple test of the library. Furthermore there are five folders containing code testing and demonstrating basic interoperability with five popular JavaScript frameworks.

Maturity and reliability
========================
The current version is "alpha version 0.6". No features are currently locked, future versions may break backwards compatibility.

The code is stable and show no signs of bugs. To most projects using the library in its current form pose very little risk.

License
=======
The library and the guide have a 2-clause BSD license. The JavaScript frameworks included in this package are not covered by this license. They have their own respective licenses provided by the respective rights holders.
